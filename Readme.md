JAR files for Apache POI
==================================================

This gem provides a set of jar files of the for using Apache POI. Because putting things in vendor/lib sucks. 

To use it: `require 'jruby-poi'`

I have pretty much copied the packaging pattern used by neo4j-enterprise - https://github.com/dnagir/neo4j-enterprise
